# IV. Tier and Reputation

## 4.1. Method

<h3> 4.1.1. Tier determination </h3>

The tier of each user on Red Kite is determined by the total number of **Red Kite points** they own. Users can earn Red Kite points through the following ways:
1. Staking PKF, PolkaFoundry native token, on Red Kite. Each staked PKF will earn **1 Red Kite point.**
2. Adding PKF-ETH to Uniswap V2 liquidity pool to get LP-PKF, then staking them to Red Kite. Each staked LP-PKF will earn **400 Red Kite points.**

::: warning Note
(*) On September 1st, the 2nd batch of the Kusama parachain auction will begin. We’ll walk you through the process of joining PolkaSmith’s crowdloan on Red Kite and announce the associated rewards in a separate article.

<h3> 4.1.2. Snapshot time </h3>

At the time a pool stops accepting whitelist registrations, we use the snapshot method to determine each user’s tier and token allocation. Until the pool’s sale ends, whitelisters must maintain a tier equal to or greater than the tier defined at the snapshot time. Any case of tier reduction during this period will result in the inability to join the pool. After the snapshot, users can continue to earn more Red Kite points to increase their tier. The new tier is only valid for pools that have not taken a snapshot.
