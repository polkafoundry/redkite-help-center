# IV. Tier and Reputation

## 4.1. Method

<h3> 4.1.1. Tier determination </h3>

The tier of each user on Red Kite is determined by the total number of Red Kite points they own. Users can earn Red Kite points through the following ways:
1. Staking PKF, PolkaFoundry native token, on Red Kite. Each staked PKF will earn 1 Red Kite point.
2. Adding PKF-ETH to Uniswap liquidity pool to get LP-PKF, then staking them to Red Kite. Each staked LP-PKF will earn 400 Red Kite points.
3. Contributing KSM, Kusama native token, to PolkaSmith’s crowdloan on Red Kite. Each locked KSM will earn 500 Red Kite points(*)

::: warning Note
(*) Read [**HERE**](https://medium.com/polkafoundry/polkasmith-kusama-parachain-auction-in-a-nutshell-e73892169719) to know more about the reward policies for KSM contributors.
:::

We no longer count the PKF staking on MANTRA DAO. If you have PKFs staked there, please unstake then re-stake them into Red Kite Launchpad.
::: tip Example
For example, John is staking 1,000 PKF and 20 LP-PKF, locking 2 KSM in the PolkaSmith’s crowdloan on Red Kite.

The number of Red Kite points John is owning = 1,000 + 20 * 400 + 2 * 500 = 10,000. According to the Tier conditions in Section 2, John is a Hawk.

<h3> 4.1.2. Snapshot time </h3>

For a specific pool, the tier and token allocation of each user will be determined by the snapshot method at the time of closing the whitelist form of that pool.

From the snapshot moment until the pool’s sale ends, whitelisters need to maintain their tier equal to or higher than the tier defined at the snapshot time. Any case of tier reduction during this period will forfeit the right to join the pool.

After the snapshot, users can continue to earn more Red Kite points to increase their tier. The new tier is only valid for pools that have not taken a snapshot.
