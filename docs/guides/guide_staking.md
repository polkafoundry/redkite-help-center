## 6.1. Overview

* Staking is a new feature developed by Red Kite to increase the profits of users, who are staking PKF or LP-PKF on Red Kite, when participating in staking pools.
* Staking does not require a minimum user tier, so all you have to do is connect to your wallet and join these pools.
* Currently, users can only stake PKF or LP-PKF on Red Kite. Staking pools for IDO project tokens (multi-token staking pools) will be supported in the coming Q4. Please stay tuned to our official channels to be the first to get news!
