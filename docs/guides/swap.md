## 2.2. Check your buy time

Red Kite includes 2 token purchasing phases, which are:

* **Phase 1:** For members with guaranteed allocation. If you are the winner of the pool and won an allocation, please purchase within Phase 1.
* **Phase 2:** At the end of Phase 1, if there are still any tokens left, this amount of tokens will be opened for sale in Phase 2 for everyone on the whitelist (whether winning or not winning the lottery and get guaranteed allocation or not). Each person will be able to buy up to a maximum of $ worth of tokens in the form of FCFS. The maximum amount is determined by each project.

Please check carefully the purchase time on the Token Swap area.

* This step is required when the currencies required by the pool are non-native tokens. You must approve their use on the pool's smart contract. For pools using ETH or BNB (native tokens), this step is skipped.  
* You need to ***Approve once (and only once)*** before you can start purchasing.
* Navigate to “Swap Tokens” area:
  * Check your “Max Allocation, Buy Time” information. (1)
  * Input the amount you want to approve (or click Max to auto-fill with your max). (2) 
  * The token will be automatically calculated based on the amount you input and the exchange rate. (3)
  * Confirm all the information and click “Approve” button. (4)
