### There is no BSC DEX or CEX for $PKF. How can I use BSC for Red Kite? Is there any explanation for that?

* PKF is only available on Ethereum and you have to stake PKF on Ethereum network 

* Red Kite supports launching both ETH  & BSC tokens. It is the token of the project under launch, not related to PKF.

### Failure to perform the following operations on BSC network using MetaMask wallet: Approve - Swap - Claim

Recently, several users have got into trouble with wallet connection, which leads to the non-display of wallet balance, and issues once applying whitelist or staking.
To deal with those problems, we recommend users to change RPC URL to public node as the following steps:
For users using MetaMask wallet:
1️⃣ Choose MetaMask Extension 
2️⃣ Go to setting page 
3️⃣ Choose Networks tab 
4️⃣ Choose Binance Smart Chain/BSC 
5️⃣ Change RPC URL to https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/
