# STAKING

---

### Can I stake $PKF in BSC or ETH to get into tiers? 

Staking $PKF is only on ETH network. Buying IDO tokens can be on ETH or BSC network (depending on the project decision).

### Does holding $PKF on gate.io or MantraDAO count towards IDOs staking?

No, you must stake on Red Kite.

### I staked my PKF, transaction approved, it still doesn't show anything under "Staked" column on Red Kite. What should do I do? 

Please make sure that you did two steps. 

* Step 1. Approve Red Kite smart contract
