# STAKING

---

### Can I stake $PKF in BSC or ETH to get into tiers? 

Staking $PKF is only on ETH network. Buying IDO tokens can be on ETH or BSC network (depending on the project decision).

### Does holding $PKF on gate.io or MantraDAO count towards IDOs staking?

No, you must stake on Red Kite.
