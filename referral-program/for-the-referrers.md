## How to Refer a friend

Go to **My Account** > **My Referrals** > **Overview Tab** Invite your friends by one of these two methods:&#x20;

* (1) Select the copy icon to share the unique referral code of your preferred method&#x20;
* (2) Sharing your personal referral link through social media (Twitter, Telegram, Facebook, or Telegram)

Once you've shared your Referral code, your friends will need to click on the link you sent along with the referral code and complete the Onboarding Process.&#x20;

## My Referral History&#x20;

To find your Referral History, first click on the **Referral History** tab of the **My Referrals** menu.  Your Referral history will show a list of friends that you have successfully referred and the allocation you have earned.

The allocation will automatically be calculated for you once your friends complete the Onboarding Process.&#x20;
