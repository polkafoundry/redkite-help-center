* _**Airdrop to participants’ wallets**_: The tokens will be airdropped straight to the wallet you used to swap tokens.
* _**Claim a part of tokens on Red Kite**_: You can claim a portion of your tokens on Red Kite, and the rest will be claimed via the project website or vesting portal.

**3. Total Bought Tokens**: The total number of tokens that you have purchased.

**4. Have Bought**: Your spent allocation
