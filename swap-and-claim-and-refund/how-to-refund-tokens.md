## 1. **What is the Refund Feature?**&#x20;

By using the IDO refund mechanism, users can decide whether to receive their money back after observing how the token performs on the market. This feature provides a risk-free approach for active IDO investors to participate in the token sale.

## 2. Effective Date

The refund function will take effect on **JUNE 23** and will apply to all IDOs from that date forward.

## 3. Applicable Scope

Users and investors join IDOs on Red Kite launchpad.

## 4. Terms and Conditions of Refund

* Users/Investors who have successfully purchased tokens but **have yet to claim any tokens** are eligible to request a refund.&#x20;
* The refund request must be submitted within **the refund request period**, <mark style="color:red;">**which is 15 minutes before & after the TGE / Token listing event**</mark>. **Any investors who fail to make a decision within the specified time will not receive a refund.**&#x20;
  * **Note: Refund decisions are up to the users. Users are supposed to take responsibility for their actions.**
* Only pools in which users/investors have claimed tokens through the Red Kite launchpad are eligible for refunds. **Refunds are not available for pools with the claim type “Airdrop”.**&#x20;
