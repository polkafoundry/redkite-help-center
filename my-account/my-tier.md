The “**My Tier**” menu includes 3 tabs: “**Overview**”, “**Reputation Point**” and “**Tier Benefits**”

## **3.1. Overview**

**Your Tier:** Your current tier. Click the “**Tier Benefits**” tab to check the policies and benefits of the four tiers, Phoenix, Eagle, Hawk, and Dove, on the Red Kite launchpad.

**Total Red Kite Point (RKPs):** The total number of Red Kite points you own. Your tier on Red Kite is determined by this number. Red Kite points can be earned through the following ways:

* Staking PKF, PolkaFoundry native token, on Red Kite. Each staked PKF will earn 1 Red Kite point.
* Adding PKF-ETH to Uniswap liquidity pool to get LP-PKF, then staking them to Red Kite. Each staked LP-PKF will earn 400 Red Kite points. [**However, the UNI-V2 LP-PKF pool has stopped receiving LP-PKF staking**](https://twitter.com/PolkaFoundry/status/1444950425426284544?s=20)**. This policy is applied from October 4, 2021, until a new announcement.**&#x20;
* Earning Reputation by staking PKF or LP-PKF on Red Kite. Reputation is the number of Red Kite points given to loyal launchpad users, calculated by the Reputation multiplier. Find out more about the User’s Reputation System on Red Kite here.

**Staking Information**: Check your staked amount of PKF or LP-PKF and the Red kite points you have earned through the User’s Reputation System. The total Red Kite Points is the sum of the “Red Kite Points” column.

**NOTE**: Users who are still staking PKF – LP-PKF in the old contract of Red Kite should unstake and stake in the new one. Please read the following article about the Red Kite's Staking Policy:
