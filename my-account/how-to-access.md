You must first connect your wallet to access the “**My Account**” menu. Find out more about how to connect wallet on Red Kite here.

After connecting your wallet, you can see the “My Account” menu on the header. The “**My Account**” menu includes 4 sub-menus: “**My Profile**”, “**My Tier**”, “**My Pool**”, and “**Need Help**”.
