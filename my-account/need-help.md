# Need Help

If you have any questions or need instructions on how to use the features of Red Kites, please click on the “Need Help” menu on the left side of the screen. There you will find the Red Kite Support Email (support@polkafoundry.com), Guide, and Frequently Asked Questions.

We also built the Red Kite Help Center for users to easily follow the guideline and find answers to questions related to using Red Kite at https://redkite-faq.polkafoundry.com/. We will regularly update its content and frequently ask questions.
